# Zalmon (aka Salmon & Salmon the King)


## Bio

Zalmon is a concept art, animation, illustration, and pixel artist currently residing in Warsaw, Poland. With his multifaceted skill set, Zalmon brings a unique perspective to each of his creations, showcasing his imagination and wide-ranging sources of inspiration.

## Intro Text

Zalmon is the first to be featured in Artgram’s new Artist Spotlight series, which highlights staff and community-chosen artist picks from within the Artgram website. We invite the spotlight artists to offer us a glimpse into their creative lives, so that we could gain insight into their personal sources of inspiration and artistic process.

## Sub-Intro 1

We’ll start off with the basics and get to more in-depth questions later on.




## Questions (part 1)
<ol>
<li>
	<strong> Q: What media and tools do you like to work with most?</strong> <br>
	
A: Hard round brush, aliased bucket fill, random noise.
	</li><br>
	
<li>
<strong> Q: Can you tell us a little about your process?  </strong><br>
	
A: I spend a long, long, long time getting reference and pondering over the design. If it doesn't look good in my head, it won't look good anywhere. I make sure to have a good silhouette and value distribution. Then I enter ape brain art machine flow state and just draw. If I find a roadblock I return to step one and repeat as many times as needed. 90% of my process is imagination, so I have no idea how people with aphantasia do it. 
	</li> <br>

<li>
	<strong>Q:  Which piece(s) in your Portfolio are you most proud of?</strong> <br>

A: The animation with the robot and spaceship.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: Any recollection you’d like to share about your early creative efforts, or about what shaped your particular style or interests?</strong> <br>
	
A: At 17 I decided to draw a comic as cool as Dead Leaves, FLCL or Redline. I was still amateurish back then - of course I couldn't - so I redrew it over four or five times and kept practicing until I could. It took several years, and by the end it was still not as cool as the inspirations, but cool enough. It was a huge part of how I got good.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: If you could sum up the importance and value of art and artmaking in your life, how would you describe it?</strong> <br>
	
A: It's the point of being alive. I wanted to do it at age five, maybe earlier too but I can't remember. If I couldn't make art for whatever reason, I'd still try to focus on art in other ways. And really the reason why I make art, is because no one else makes the art that I want to get made. Or at least, not every kind of it. I don't really know what else there is to life.
	</li><br>


<li>
<strong> Q: If you could give advice to your younger self, or to younger artists interested in a professional career, what would it be? </strong><br>
	
A: 
- Think about fifty times before you decide to do art for a job. It's a good choice for some but also potentially a great way to make it not fun. Is there anything else you could be doing?
- "X years of experience required" means nothing. Really, they all say that.
- Don't get too brash in the interview, they will praise you but until you have the job, they can change their mind in an instant.
- There's cool original art and then there's boring but marketable art. Too much of the first gets you no jobs, too much of the second gets you bad ones, and the good ones are in-between.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: If you could give advice to young artists about the personal aspects of making art and living a life enriched by art, what would you say? </strong><br>

A: Look as hard as you can. Pick a random country and figure out what they do. Pick a random century. A random country and century. Pick some kind of art that people swear by but seems completely baffling to you and actively try to enjoy it. I used to despise abstract modern art with a passion and now I look up to it. Hell, I used to hate hard sci-fi, and here I am looking at research papers to draw my spaceship. Don't just look at what someone tries to sell you.

## Sub-Intro 2

Okay, basics aside, I have a few questions to dive a bit deeper into your work and how you approach it.


## Questions (part 2)
<ol>
<li>
	<strong>Q: What interests you in the mecha subjects, as well as the organic machine hybrids and do you try to tell stories with each of your pieces? If so, where do those stories and the motivation behind them come from? Each of the pieces that you shared earlier has a pretty intricate/vivid backstory, so what inspires them in your mind? </strong><br>

A: Drawing takes a lot of time, and I have to think about something in the meantime, so when I draw, a lot of backstory emerges from my head. Later when I make another piece, I might choose to relate it to previous works, both because it’s more fun that way and to show that I can create a consistent world that many designs fit into. 

The organic machine hybrids are just a creative exercise, I wanted to design a creature that’s strange and disturbing to look at. It’s a very strong but intangible feeling so it’s enjoyable to try and grasp. 

Most of my works start as a simple prompt like “an X which is Y and Z”, it’s just that when they lack a backstory, my brain fills in the void. Mecha in particular are somewhere between character and hard surface design, so they’re an interesting challenge.
	</li><br>
</ol>

## Questions (part 3)
<ol>
<li>
	<strong>Q: That makes sense. What inspired the backstory behind both the Monopoly on Violence piece and Missile Saint? Both tell a pretty strong story, in my opinion, though in different ways. Many of your pieces seem to be that way, though. There’s a lot of what feels like a mix of social commentary and your own imagination. On your website’s bio, you say, “I aim to put thought into every detail and look for inspiration in less obvious places”. What are those places, oftentimes?</strong><br>

A: Missile Saint is a mix of different parts, like the holy hand grenade of Antioch, the Brahmāstra from Hindu mythology, self-mummifying monks and one photo edit I saw where a church spire or minaret, can’t remember, took off like a rocket. Monopoly on Violence does indeed have some social commentary, although it’s largely incidental to me wanting to draw alternate future cops having lunch, and to have more of a full scene rather than just designs floating in a white void. I like to mix perfectly ordinary and outlandish or speculative concepts, it makes the former more interesting and the latter more believable, without sacrificing what makes either of them good.

Where I get my inspiration can’t be easily summarized, it’s different every time. The principle, I feel, is that when I draw a spaceship, I shouldn’t just reference other spaceship designs - what about an animal, a vegetable, an article of clothing, a building? One thing I can massively recommend that doesn’t get used enough, is abstract art, especially sculpture.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong>Q: Do you find yourself thinking of your work in abstract ways? Either early in the process or later on?</strong><br>

A: All the time. What feeling do I want from this → what shapes and colors would accomplish that → how do I make these shapes and colors with readable physical elements. But the main function of referencing abstract art, in my experience, isn’t this; the main function is that you get to see forms that you won’t see in anything else.
	</li><br>


<li>
<strong>Q: In an earlier response, you had mentioned that you used to despise abstract modern art with a passion and now look up to it. What led to that change of perspective/heart?</strong><br>

A: A combination of learning more about art in general, and growing tired of repetitive designs. There’s a lot of incredible nuance and innovation in abstract art because it has to defend itself purely as art, it can’t rely on reference to reality.

Everyone can make a monster feel dangerous, can you make a square feel dangerous?
