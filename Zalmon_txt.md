We invite the spotlight artists to offer us a glimpse into their creative lives, so that we could gain insight into their personal sources of inspiration and artistic process.

## Sub-Intro 1

We’ll start off with the basics and get to more in-depth questions later on.




## Questions (part 1)
<ol>
<li>
	<strong> Q: What media and tools do you like to work with most?</strong> <br>
	
A: Hard round brush, aliased bucket fill, random noise.
	</li><br>
	
<li>
<strong> Q: Can you tell us a little about your process?  </strong><br>
	
A: I spend a long, long, long time getting reference and pondering over the design. If it doesn't look good in my head, it won't look good anywhere. I make sure to have a good silhouette and value distribution. Then I enter ape brain art machine flow state and just draw. If I find a roadblock I return to step one and repeat as many times as needed. 90% of my process is imagination, so I have no idea how people with aphantasia do it.

	<strong>Q:  Which piece(s) in your Portfolio are you most proud of?</strong> <br>

A: The animation with the robot and spaceship.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: Any recollection you’d like to share about your early creative efforts, or about what shaped your particular style or interests?</strong> <br>
	
A: At 17 I decided to draw a comic as cool as Dead Leaves, FLCL or Redline. I was still amateurish back then - of course I couldn't - so I redrew it over four or five times and kept practicing until I could. It took several years, and by the end it was still not as cool as the inspirations, but cool enough. It was a huge part of how I got good.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: If you could sum up the importance and value of art and artmaking in your life, how would you describe it?</strong> <br>
	
A: It's the point of being alive. I wanted to do it at age five, maybe earlier too but I can't remember. If I couldn't make art for whatever reason, I'd still try to focus on art in other ways. And really the reason why I make art, is because no one else makes the art that I want to get made. Or at least, not every kind of it. I don't really know what else there is to life.
	</li><br>


<li>
<strong> Q: If you could give advice to your younger self, or to younger artists interested in a professional career, what would it be? </strong><br>
	
A: 
- Think about fifty times before you decide to do art for a job. It's a good choice for some but also potentially a great way to make it not fun. Is there anything else you could be doing?
- "X years of experience required" means nothing. Really, they all say that.
- Don't get too brash in the interview, they will praise you but until you have the job, they can change their mind in an instant.
- There's cool original art and then there's boring but marketable art. Too much of the first gets you no jobs, too much of the second gets you bad ones, and the good ones are in-between.
	</li><br>

<li>
<strong> Q: If you could give advice to young artists about the personal aspects of making art and living a life enriched by art, what would you say? </strong><br>

A: Look as hard as you can. Pick a random country and figure out what they do. Pick a random century. A random country and century. Pick some kind of art that people swear by but seems completely baffling to you and actively try to enjoy it. I used to despise abstract modern art with a passion and now I look up to it. Hell, I used to hate hard sci-fi, and here I am looking at research papers to draw my spaceship. Don't just look at what someone tries to sell you.

## Sub-Intro 2

Okay, fundamentals aside, I have a few questions to dive a bit deeper into your work and how you approach it.


## Questions (part 2)
<ol>
<li>
	<strong>Q: What interests you in the mecha subjects, as well as the organic machine hybrids and do you try to tell stories with each of your pieces? If so, where do those stories and the motivation behind them come from? Each of the pieces that you shared earlier has a pretty intricate/vivid backstory, so what inspires them in your mind? </strong><br>

A: Drawing takes a lot of time, and I have to think about something in the meantime, so when I draw, a lot of backstory emerges from my head. Later when I make another piece, I might choose to relate it to previous works, both because it’s more fun that way and to show that I can create a consistent world that many designs fit into. 

The organic machine hybrids are just a creative exercise, I wanted to design a creature that’s strange and disturbing to look at. It’s a very strong but intangible feeling so it’s enjoyable to try and grasp. 

Most of my works start as a simple prompt like “an X which is Y and Z”, it’s just that when they lack a backstory, my brain fills in the void. Mecha in particular are somewhere between character and hard surface design, so they’re an interesting challenge.
